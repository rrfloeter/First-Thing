To-Do List: 

The incorporation of a to-do list to this webpage was created by linking the data from the the to-do list as well as incorporating authentication functions through firebase.
The ability to access the to-do list is only possible through signing up or being logged into the website - as items are removed (clicked off) this is sent back to Firebase and the data is removed per the click-event.

The technologies used for the to-do List:
Firebase
jQuery
JavaScript

Weather:

Using a Google Geolocation API POST request, we find the user's approximate GPS coordinates and weather is displayed for their location using a GET request from OpenWeatherMap Weather API. A 4-day forecast for those coordinates is displayed below.

Technologies used for weather.js:

OpenWeatherMap Weather API
Google Geolocation API
Moment.js
jQuery
Bootstrap
JavaScript

News:

Using the New York Times API, we pull top three stories as it breaks to keep the user updated with the latest news. Instead of adding a seperate url line we have hyperlinked article title to the full article url to make it look professional. Also, the user can open the full article in a new tab which allows those who are always multitasking to have multiple tabs open.

Technologies used for news.js:

New York Times Developer Network Top Stories API
JQuery
Moment.js
